# Performance-Modeling-Projects
Some submitted assignments from my performance modeling class.

Largest assignment was for an asian call option problem, modeling the behavior of the asian
call option which is a technique for financial forecasting in stocks, typically favored over
another type of option called the American option because it limits risk to the investment
firm.  

The assignment detailed the intricacies of the Asian option and gave the constants.  From there
I developed some pseudo code and then pushed forward from there.  I chose to use Java because
it is the language that I'm most familiar with.  The class had the options of using Python or Java
because of the statistics libraries that were involved.  In Java we used ssj and in Python we used
Simpy.
